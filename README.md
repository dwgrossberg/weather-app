## Key Features :

- Users can search for the current weather and five-day forecast for any place on Earth, via the free OpenWeather API

- Displays key weather metrics such as temperature, current weather icon and description, location-specific date and time, as well as the "feels-like" temperature, humidity, wind-speed, and sunrise/sunset

- Users can easily switch between temperature units (°C & °F) for current weather and the five-day forecast

- Makes use of JavaScript's built-in `Geolocation API` (as well as OpenCage Data's Reverse Geocoding API) to display the weather according to each user's actual location on page-load

- Background image changes depending on the weather condition and the time of day

- Features a responsive, mobile-friendly design

## Learning Outcomes :

- Strengthened understanding of working with asynchronous functions, using `async`, `await`, and the JavaScript `Promise` API

- Learned how to fetch and parse data by working with several different APIs

- Improved ability to manipulate date-times and to work with UTC times
